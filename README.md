# PlugAndPlay: QWIIC Adapter
This is the repository with the files for PlugAndPlay adapter for QWIIC/STEMA QT devices.

That module allows connecting QWIIC/STEMA QT devices to the Plug-n-Play system with the JST-SH 4/6pin cables and includes also a 2pin female header that allows connection of the 2 interrupt lines that is used by the Plug-n-Play system.
The 2 interrupt lines are available as 2 solder holes as well, for those who are interested in a more permanent connection.
